h1. Warbler isnt working for me

to setup the way I have it setup in my environment is to run the two vendor rake tasks

@jruby -S gem install warbler@

@jruby -S rake rails:freeze:gems@

@jruby -S rake unpack:gems@

@jruby -S rake db:create:all@

@jruby -S rake db:migrate@

@warble war@

and uplaod that to tomcat on localhost

problem: its not running
